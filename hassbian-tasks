LOGIN TO THE RASPBERRY PI

To login to your Raspberry Pi running HASSbian you’re going to be using a ssh client. Depending on your platform there are several alternatives for doing this. Linux and Max OS generally have a ssh client installed. Windows users are recommended to download and install the ssh client Putty.

Connect to the Raspberry Pi over ssh. Default user name is pi and password is raspberry. Linux and Mac OS users execute the following command in a terminal.

$ ssh pi@ip-address-of-pi
Windows users start Putty, enter the IP address of the Raspberry Pi in the Host name field and port 22 in the Port field. Then click Open and a terminal window will open. Enter the credentials. Default user name is pi and password is raspberry.

Optionally, starting with Windows 10 anniversary update, you can use the built-in ‘Bash on Windows’ to use SSH if you have enabled Developer mode and have installed the “Windows Subsystem for Linux (beta)” feature.

START/STOP/RESTART HOME ASSISTANT

Log in as the pi account account and execute the following commands:

$ sudo systemctl stop home-assistant@homeassistant.service 
Replace stop with start or restart to get the desired functionality. To get the current state of the homeassistant.service replace stop with status.

UPDATE HOME ASSISTANT

Log in as the pi account and execute the following commands:

$ sudo systemctl stop home-assistant@homeassistant.service 
$ sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
$ source /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate
$ pip3 install --upgrade homeassistant
$ exit
$ sudo systemctl start home-assistant@homeassistant.service
This will in order do the following:

Stop the Home Assistant service running on HASSbian
Open a shell as the homeassistant user running the Homeassistant service and that has ownership over the Home Assistant installation.
Change into the virtual Python environment at /srv/homeassistant/ containing the Home Assistant installation.
Upgrade the Home Assistant installation to the latest release.
Exit the shell and return to the pi user.
Restart the Home Assistant service.
MANUALLY LAUNCH HOME ASSISTANT

Log in as the pi account and execute the following commands:

$ sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
$ source /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate
$ hass
This will start Home Assistant in your shell and output anything that ends up in the log and more into the console. This will fail if the Home Assistant service is already running so don’t forget to stop it first.

CHECK YOUR CONFIGURATION

Log in as the pi account and execute the following commands:

$ sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
$ source /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate
$ hass --script check_config
This will output any errors in your configuration files to console.

READ THE HOME ASSISTANT LOG FILE

Log in as the pi account and execute the following commands:

$ sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
$ cd /home/homeassistant/.homeassistant
$ nano home-assistant.log
This will in order do the following:

Open a shell as the homeassistant user.
Change directory to the Home Assistant configuration directory.
Open the log file in the nano editor.
Optionally, you can also view the log with journalctl. Log in as the pi account and execute the following commands:

$ sudo journalctl -fu home-assistant@homeassistant.service
EDIT THE HOME ASSISTANT CONFIGURATION

Log in as the pi account and execute the following commands:

$ sudo su -s /bin/bash homeassistant
$ cd /home/homeassistant/.homeassistant
$ nano configuration.yaml
This will in order do the following:

Open a shell as the homeassistant user.
Change directory to the Home Assistant configuration directory.
Open the configuration file in the nano editor.
It’s generally recommended that you read the Getting started guide for how to configure Home Assistant.

CHANGE LOCALE, TIMEZONE AND KEYBOARD LAYOUT

$ sudo raspi-config

Python 3.7 for Home Automation
I got told to update my Pi3 for HA to continue running.
I am not sure how typical my system is, I just installed it using the instructions on the HA website and it worked.
These are my notes for next time:

sudo apt-get install build-essential tk-dev libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libreadline6-dev libdb5.3-dev libgdbm-dev libsqlite3-dev libssl-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev zlib1g-dev

wget -O /tmp/Python-3.7.3.tar.xz https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/Python-3.7.3.tar.xz

cd /tmp

tar xf Python-3.7.3.tar.xz

cd Python-3.7.3

./configure

sudo make altinstall

sudo apt -y autoremove

cd

rm -r /tmp/Python-3.7.3

rm /tmp/Python-3.7.3.tar.xz

sudo systemctl stop home-assistant@homeassistant.service

sudo mv /srv/homeassistant /srv/homeassistant_old

sudo mkdir /srv/homeassistant

sudo chown homeassistant:homeassistant -R /srv/homeassistant

cd /srv/homeassistant

/usr/local/bin/python3.7 -m venv .

source bin/activate

pip install wheel homeassistant

** Note I chose to run hass first time to see all the installation messages.**

sudo systemctl start home-assistant@homeassiith Python 3.7.3
